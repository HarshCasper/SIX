SIX is a Web-Chat Application that has been built using Web Socket Server and Node.js to provide a basic Chat Functionality with 
anonymous chatting feature and additional features which allows the user to set alias while chatting. It has been also deployed to
Heroku which extends the application on a Cloud Platform as a Platform as a Service (PaaS). 

## Technology Stack 

- Node.js : Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
Node.js is based on an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking Input/Output API that is designed to optimize an application's throughput and scalability for real-time web applications.

- HTML and CSS: HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

- Web Sockets: Web sockets are defined as a two-way communication between the servers and the clients, which mean both the parties, communicate and exchange data at the same time. This protocol defines a full duplex communication from the ground up. They allow a long-held single TCP socket connection to be established between the client and server which allows for bi-directional, full duplex, messages to be instantly distributed with little overhead resulting in a very low latency connection.

## Deployment

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. The Application has been likewise deployed [here](https://harshcasper.herokuapp.com/).
